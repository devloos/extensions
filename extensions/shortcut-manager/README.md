# Shortcut Manager

- This extension is designed to handle all of your application's keyboard shortcuts. It will manage them for you so you don't have to.
- If there are keyboard shortcuts you need that aren't already supported, you can create them yourself using this extension.
- The extension provides an intuitive way to manage your hotkeys, so you can easily customize them to suit your needs.
- The extension can also help you identify if there are any duplicate hotkeys being used across your application, so you can avoid conflicts and ensure everything works as intended.

### Important

- The System and Raycast applications are default applications that come with the extension and cannot be removed.
- These default applications are global, which means that all hotkeys defined in them will be checked for duplication.
- In other words, if you define a hotkey in one of these default applications and then try to use the same hotkey in another application, you will be notified of the conflict.

### Future Plans

- I intend to introduce many small features that will improve user flow and overall ease of use.
- Additionally, I plan to pull user-defined hotkeys from the applications we support directly into our extension.
- This will significantly reduce the amount of manual labor required to manage hotkeys, making the overall experience smoother and more user-friendly.
- Finally, if anyone would like to contribute to the project, your contributions would be welcomed and appreciated.
